# GCD-Calculator
This is a CLI program that is used to find GCD (Greatest Common Denominator) using Euclidean Algorithm (Extended)

# Reason for writitng this program
We were studying Discrete Mathematics in university as required course in software engineering department, and we were doing the computation by hand.

I just got bored one day and challenged myself to implement the Euclidean Algorithm (with its extension) in C++. It was a good learning experience and a well rounded challenge.
